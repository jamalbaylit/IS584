    "# Transformer Architecture Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the content from the notebook, here are answers to the questions about transformer architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Why do we implement PositionalEncoding in part 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional Encoding is implemented because transformers don't have any inherent understanding of sequence order since they process tokens in parallel rather than sequentially. As explained in the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have Positional Encoding, which we require for the Transformer model to understand and relate the relative position of input and output tokens or embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook implements positional encoding using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the model to inject information about token positions without losing the benefits of parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How do we feed Query, Key, and Value to the multi-head attention blocks?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook's `MultiHeadAttention` class implementation, Query, Key, and Value are processed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input tensors are linearly projected to create query, key, and value representations:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   query = self.split_heads(self.query_linear(query), batch_size)\n",
    "   key = self.split_heads(self.key_linear(key), batch_size)\n",
    "   value = self.split_heads(self.value_linear(value), batch_size) \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. These projections are split across multiple attention heads using the `split_heads` method\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attention scores are computed between query and key:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   attention_weights = self.compute_attention(query, key, mask)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The attention weights are applied to the values:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Results from all heads are concatenated and projected to the output dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the purpose of the mask (self_attention_mask) defined in Part 9?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self_attention_mask` in Part 9 is a causal mask that creates a triangular attention pattern. Its purpose is to prevent the decoder from \"cheating\" by looking at future tokens when making predictions. The notebook explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The triangular mask defined here is the causal mask that prohibits the decoder from observing the \"future\" or cheating. For the first element in the sequence, the decoder can only observe the first element; for the second, the second and the first; and for the nth element, the decoder can only observe elements (tokens) up to the nth element.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-attention**: Involves computing attention where query, key, and value all come from the same sequence. Used in both encoders and decoders to allow tokens to attend to other tokens in the same sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-attention**: Used in the decoder layers of encoder-decoder transformers to attend to encoder outputs. The notebook states:\n",
    "  > The second attention mechanism in the Decoder architecture is Encoder-Decoder attention, or cross-attention layer. The keys and values come from the output of the Encoder stack while queries come from the first self-attention layer of the Decoder stack. With this cross-attention, decoder can attend over all positions in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Where exactly is the cross-attention mask applied in the vanilla transformer architecture?\n",
